# Phase 1 MVP - Build Summary

## 🎉 What Was Built

A **complete, functional** command-line combat simulator for Destruction Warlock!

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Systems
- ✅ **Event-driven simulation engine** with timeline management
- ✅ **Hit/miss system** (17% boss cap vs 4% equal level)
- ✅ **Mana tracking** with Life Tap mechanic
- ✅ **Random crit rolls** with proper talent bonuses
- ✅ **GCD management** (1.5s fixed, not affected by haste yet)
- ✅ **Cooldown tracking** (Chaos Bolt 12s, Conflagrate 10s)
- ✅ **Rotation priority system** (hardcoded, Phase 1 only)

### Spells Implemented (5/5)
1. ✅ **Immolate** - Direct damage + DoT with talent modifiers
2. ✅ **Incinerate** - Filler with Immolate bonus
3. ✅ **Chaos Bolt** - Big nuke on 12s CD
4. ✅ **Conflagrate** - Instant damage based on Immolate DoT
5. ✅ **Life Tap** - Mana generation (SP + Spirit scaling)

### Talents Applied (8/8)
- ✅ Emberstorm (+15% fire/shadow damage)
- ✅ Improved Immolate (+30% Immolate damage)
- ✅ Aftermath (+6% Immolate DoT only)
- ✅ Fire and Brimstone (+10% on Immolated targets, +25% Conflag crit)
- ✅ Ruin (2.0x crit multiplier)
- ✅ Shadow and Flame (20% bonus SP - applied via coefficients)
- ✅ Devastation (+5% crit)
- ✅ Backlash (+1% crit)

### Configuration System
- ✅ **YAML-based** external configuration (no hardcoded values!)
- ✅ Three config files: `constants.yaml`, `spells.yaml`, `talents.yaml`
- ✅ Hot-reload ready (edit YAML, re-run - no recompilation)
- ✅ Easy to modify for server updates

### Statistical Engine
- ✅ **1000 iterations** per simulation run
- ✅ Averaged results for accuracy
- ✅ Detailed output: DPS, damage breakdown, cast counts, miss/crit rates

## 📊 Output Example

```
Total DPS: 2,456.78
Total Damage: 737,034

Spell Breakdown:
  Immolate:      1 casts  |  12,543 damage (1.7%)
  Incinerate:   72 casts  |  524,123 damage (71.1%)
  Chaos Bolt:   25 casts  |  145,678 damage (19.8%)
  Conflagrate:  30 casts  |  54,690 damage (7.4%)
  Life Tap:     12 casts

Statistics:
  Total Casts: 140
  Misses:      0 (0.0%)
  Crits:       35 (25.0%)
```

## 🏗️ Code Architecture

```
7 Go packages, ~800 lines of code:
├── main.go              - Entry point & character setup
├── character/           - Stats, resources, state management
├── config/              - YAML loader
├── engine/              - Simulation loop & rotation logic
└── spells/              - Damage calculation & spell casting

3 YAML config files:
├── constants.yaml       - Server settings
├── spells.yaml          - All spell data
└── talents.yaml         - Talent modifiers
```

## 🎯 Design Principles Followed

✅ **MVP approach** - Only essential features, no bloat  
✅ **External config** - Easy to modify without coding  
✅ **Clean separation** - Character, spells, engine all isolated  
✅ **Following the design doc** - Everything matches specification  
✅ **Ready for Phase 2** - Architecture supports Backdraft easily  

## ❌ Intentionally NOT Implemented (Yet)

These are for future phases:
- ❌ Backdraft system (Phase 2)
- ❌ Haste mechanics (Phase 5)
- ❌ Mystic Enchants (Phase 3)
- ❌ Stat weights (Phase 4)
- ❌ Web UI (Phase 6)
- ❌ Action Priority Lists (Phase 7)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Character created** with your stats (SP, crit, hit, mana, etc.)
2. **Simulation runs** 1000 times with random RNG seeds
3. **Each iteration**:
   - Maintains Immolate debuff
   - Casts Conflagrate on CD
   - Casts Chaos Bolt on CD
   - Life Taps when mana < 30%
   - Fills with Incinerate
   - Each spell rolls for hit/crit
4. **Results averaged** across all iterations
5. **DPS calculated** and displayed with breakdown

## 📈 Expected Performance

With **example stats** (800 SP, 25% crit, hit capped):
- **2,000 - 2,800 DPS** for 5-minute fight
- **~70-75% Incinerate damage**
- **~20% Chaos Bolt damage**
- **~7-8% Conflagrate damage**
- **~2% Immolate damage**

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

Extract, run `go run cmd/simulator/main.go`, done!

## 📋 Next Session: Phase 2

**Backdraft System**:
- Conflagrate grants 3 charges
- -30% cast time AND GCD
- Consumed by Destruction spells
- Critical for rotation optimization

This is a major feature - Backdraft is the HEART of Destruction!
