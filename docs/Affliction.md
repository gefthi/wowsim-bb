### Legendary
- Affliction Mastery: Increases your spell haste by 4% and the ndamage of Corruption by 6%
- Soul Harvest: Increases your magic damage and your pet's damage by 15% for 6 seocnds. Increased by 3 seconds for each target afflicted by your corruptiom, curse of agony and immolate up to maxium of 24 seconds
- Endless Agony: Dealing damage with Curse of Agony applies Endless Agony (debuff on target). Endless Agony increases your damage dealt to the target by Curse of Agony by 3% and Curse of Doom by 6%. Stacks up to 20 times and lasts for 12 seconds (obvisouly every application renews this timer). Also Dealing damage with Drain life reduces the active duration and cooldown of your Curse of Doom by 3 seconds (of course as long as there is a curse of doom on the target)
- Soul Erosion: Dealing damage with Unstable Affliction and Curse of Agony has 8% chance to increase the damage of your next Drain Soul by 200% (500% if target has below 25% health). Drain Soul cast this way only lasts for 6 seconds but it is immune to spell pushback. In addition using Drain Soul the duration of your Haunt, Unstable Affliction and shadow embrace is not reduced on the target

### Epic
- Curse Weaver: You can apply an additional Curse to the same target. Corruption deals 4% more damage oer Curse you have applied to the target
- Dark Harvest: Dealing perioding damage with Corruption, Curse of Agony or Unstable affliction increase the damage of your next Drain Life by 5% stacking up to 10 times.
- Eternal Torment: Casting Haunt on a target already affected by your Haunt makes it guaranteed critical strike. Your Haunt increases the damage over time effects by an additional 5%
- Doomcaller's Wrath: Using Curse of Doom grants you erradication. (so requires Erradication 3/3 talent). Duration of Erradication is increased by 5 seconds. Increases the damage of Curse of Doom by 30%

### Rare
- Glypg of Quick Decay: Your haste now reduces the time between periodic damage ticks of your Corruption spell
- Glyph of Haunt: The bonus damage granded by your Haunt spells is increased by an additional 3%
- Glyph of Curse of Agony: Increases the duration of your Curse of Agony by 4 seconds
- Unholy Power: Increases the damage done by your Felhunter by 20%

## Mechanics
- Haste in dots only affect their tick rate not the amount of ticks. Ticks remain the same so the total durations shortens. This applies only to Corruption if you have quick decay rare ME
- Only Corruption and Unstable affliction dot can crit and this only if we get the Pandemic Talent
- Channeled spells (drain life and drain soul) cannot crit ever and of coutse you cannot cast anything else as we channel. If we want to cast something we need to stop channeling. Keep this in mind when we setup rotations
- Not a mechanic but a note. Corr is Corruption, CoA is Curse of Agony, UA is unstable affliction
